## About

This project is a web interface built based on a Figma design. It includes HTML, CSS, and TypeScript (via a bundler) to transform the static Figma mockup into a working frontend.  

The goal is to provide a faithful translation of the UI design into clean, maintainable code — useful either as a standalone static site or as a starting point for further development or integration.

---

## Features

- Responsive frontend layout (assuming design intended for web)  
- Code structure with separate `src/` directory — easier to maintain and scale  
- Built with modern tooling (bundler + TypeScript)  
- CSS styling matching the original Figma mockup  

*(You can expand this list with more specific UI/UX features once implemented — e.g. navbar, hero section, footer, components, interactive elements, etc.)*

## Demo / Preview

*(If you have a live preview or a screenshot, add here — e.g. hosted URL, or GIF/PNG showing the UI.)*
